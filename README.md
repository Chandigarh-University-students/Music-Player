## It makes use of following:-
- **LiveData & MutableLiveData** for updating and listening to realtime datachanges in app. Also livedata can survive configuration changes.
- **ViewModel** with **ViewModelFactory** to acess livedata
- **Repository** as **single source of truth** to make Database operations
- **Coroutines** to perform databse operations in background thread without blocking main thread.
- Various Coroutine Context based on type of operation: e.g Dispatchers.Main for updaing UI in main htread and Dispatchers.IO to work in background thread.
- Also, database dao methods are defined suspend fun methods so that they run in background thread. This work is done internally by Room library automatically.
- Also, LiveData in ViewModel are update in viewModelScope, a Coroutine scope provided for livedata.

- **ConstraintLayout** for maki device compatible ui in screen.
- **BottomSheet** a material design ui component for opening a bottomsheet
- **BottomNavigationView** another material design ui component for changing tabs
